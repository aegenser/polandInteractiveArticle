# Interactive Visualization on Poland (PiS and the Poor)

This is an interactive visualization done for the class CMSC 239 at UChicago. Credit needs to be given to the TA, Andrew McNutt, for creating the original repository and scaffold for this project. The visualization can be seen at https://aegenser.github.io/polandInteractiveArticle/. The visualization is based on a non-interactive visualization I did for the class earlier, which can be found in this repository as vis.pdf. An explanation of the thought process behind that visualization can be found as writeup.pdf. Everything is exactly how I turned it in for the class.

## What could be improved
This project was completed by myself over the course of only a couple days. Given more time, and more experience with react, much could be improved.
1. Redundant/Useless code: Many files were included in the scaffold for the project that I simply made no use of. Additionally, much of the code I wrote is redundant between files, and there would certainly be a way to consolidate all of these redundant/unused files.
2. Messy code: Due do haste and lack of experience with JavaScript/React, there are definitely sections of code that could be made more efficient
3. Nicer looking format: I used the default font/font size/all other formats. This looks kind of ugly, and I would like to change it to something more pleasing.
